# NextGen-Stock-Forecaster-Time-Series-Analysis-in-Python

Advanced Stock Price Forecasting with Python

Description

This project, titled "Advanced Stock Price Forecasting with Python," aims to demonstrate the application of time series analysis in the field of finance, particularly in predicting future stock prices. Utilizing Python and its powerful libraries, this project offers a deep dive into the dynamics of stock market data, focusing on a case study with Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock.

Key elements of this project include:

Fetching historical stock price data.
Preprocessing and preparing the data for analysis.
Conducting exploratory data analysis to understand historical trends.
Implementing and training an ARIMA model for time series forecasting.
Forecasting future stock prices and visualizing predictions.
